""" Mockip UI definition file to try and work out how to build the system.

I want this to be as simple and intuitive as possible, whilst also being
powerful and easily extensible. It also needs to be pure python.

Themes is a directory holding a bunch of python packages.
ui is the GUI instance that the server is looking for. When converted to a
string it should output an HTML page with embedded hooks for the JavaScript
parts to interact with.

I like the relative elegance of nested function calls, as demoed below, 
for capturing the hierarchical structure of HTML.

The various GUI components will inherit from one of  a pair of base classes,
one for containers, the other for components.

All UI classes implement the __call__() method. Containers use *args to 
iterate through all children, simply outputting whatever they evaluate to 
when converted to strings, wrapped with a preamble and post-amble.

Components are simpler, and just return a fragment of HTML when called. Just
use simple .format() call with the **kwargs dictionary.

As well as outputting HTML, there should also be hooks for generating 
additional JavaScript and CSS for appending to the primary JS and CSS files.
By augmenting these static files rather than creating new ones it reduces the 
number of web requests that have to be made.

Example:
import themes.vanilla.*
ui = panel(
            row(
                horizontal_bar(value="bcm23", label="Temperature"),
                toggle_switch(value"bcm01", label="Fan")
                ),
            row(
                dial_meter(value="bcm12", label="Volts")
                )
               )
               
Javascript part. Basic updating of the UI with state values from the HAL
is dealt with by the basic FarPi framework. However, it is inevitable that
some components will want to run handlers when certain things happen. The
JS fragments will be collated and sent to the client, so can in theory do
anything JS can do. I should also provide hooks for code to run when the
state is updated. Given the JS frags will be run on load, there needs to be
a mechanism to register callbacks.
